# Dark Souls: Daughters of Ash
Source and game files for Dark Souls: Daughters of Ash. (Double-click installer available on Nexus.)

To install, copy all files in `/shared` into your game directory (`DATA` for Prepare to Die Edition or `DARK SOULS REMASTERED` for Dark Souls Remastered), then do the same for the folder matching your game version (`/ptde` or `/dsr`).

Select source files for AI scripts, TAE animation data, and EMEVD event scripts are available in `/src` for the curious. Note that the event scripts use my old `pydses` Python conversion library, which has now been oudated by `soulstruct`.
